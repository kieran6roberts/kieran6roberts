## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Kieran.

I'm a self taught front-end developer passionate about the problem solving and creative aspects of web development. Having graduating with an electronic enginnering degree I decided to take some time out to travel and later discovered a passion for coding, specifically front-end developement. I am now on the path of pursuing a career in this field that is constantly expanding with new and interseting topics to learn.

## Curently working on:

### YourCoffeeShop - Full stack e-commerce site
<br />

It is a site built for a fictional coffee company that require a new online presence in order to be able to sell their products. The front-end is handled by next.js and chakra-ui while the backend utilizes hasura and auth0 for user creation, auth and storage and graphcms to handle the company products. The site will include:
* product store
* persistent product cart
* persistent saved products
* user authentication
* product reviews
* checkout process
* payments
* localization

### CssOnly... - Collection of interactive components using just html and css, no javaScript.
<br />

To improve my front-end skills using html and css, I am building a collection of common interactive components that are key to modern sites. It is important that these components are still functional even with javaScript disabled. They include:
* mobile burger navigation
* hover/ focus dropdown lists
* popup modal
 
and more.
